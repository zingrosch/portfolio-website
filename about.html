            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I am a Content Specialist turned UI Designer with a passion for analogue photography and screenprinting. Those insights guide me when creating designs that speak to users and help them navigate interfaces with ease. I love getting new
              ideas, taking in different opinions and implementing them into my craft.</p>
            <p>Did you know that people look at a website for only a few seconds before they decide if they like it or not? As a UI designer, I use data to generate insights and make informed decisions.</p>
            <p>In my previous jobs, I learned a lot about user behaviour and found it so interesting, especially the psychology behind it, that I decided to go deeper into that topic.</p>
            <p>My previous job I was working in a fast-paced environments which taught me how to remain flexible during times of change. When it comes to project management I am solution-focused and good at bringing structure into chaotic situations.
            </p>
            <p>Due to my work experience in several countries, my cross-cultural communication skills are outstanding. I am good at reaching solutions among departments to meet the needs of business partners and customers alike. I would love to work
              for businesses providing an inclusive environment where I can grow, be it as a designer or in another area within UI such as user psychology or accessibility.</p>
